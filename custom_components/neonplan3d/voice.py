"""Assist asks the house: the service `neonplan3d.ask` and the intent `NeonPlanAsk`.

A sentence said to Assist (a voice satellite, the Assist dialog, an automation) is handed to the open NeonPlan
views: the first one that understands it answers, shows the place and, when asked to, speaks. The sentences
Assist recognises come from `custom_sentences/<lang>/neonplan3d.yaml`, which is written only when an admin picks
the sentences in the voice settings (never on setup, never over a file the user changed, removed with the
integration); the user may add their own sentences to the same intent in another file.
